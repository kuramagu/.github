## Submitting a pull request

0. Fork and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
2. Make your change, and make sure the tests still pass
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
4. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality
- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a good commit message with reference to [next](#write_a_commit_message).



## write a commit message

The commit message must show at a glance what changes have been made.

### What is a good commitment message?
1. Clarify why the code was changed.
	1. One commit to one objective.
	2. [prefix](#prefix)
2. Leads you to relevant information.
	1. URL to document
	2. Related Ticket Numbers


### prefix
Write certain words at the beginning of the commit message to make it easier to understand the changes in that commit.


| prefix | description |
|:---|:---|
|feat: |new feature |
|fix: |Bug Fixes |
|docs: |Document Only Changes |
|style: |Appearance-only changes that do not affect the behavior of the code (formatting, spaces, etc.) |
